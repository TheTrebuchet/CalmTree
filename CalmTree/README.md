# CalmTreeProject

I assume that if you wandered into the files of this addon, you would like to know more or less how it works. Below I will try to explain to you a bit of the code.
If you have any suggestions for improvement contact me at jan.kulczycki1@gmail.com, I will be happy to improve on anything.

## Classes

I am registering quite a few classes. Respectively, three operators to create a tree, update it when you change a parameter and sync the panel with selected tree. Then you have the panel itself and a property group of all the properties. One more class for initiating drawing and another for regrowing from a curve.
