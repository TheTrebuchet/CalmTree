# CalmTree

CalmTree is a Blender add-on for all the environment artist out there. This add-on enables the user to create complex trees quickly, whether it be for background or foreground. It is meant to give a basic or high quality tree mesh, depending on your needs. It can be used for quick drafting or almost complete asset creation.

This repo is for the free version of the addon, I plan on finishing this and moving onto a paid version.. I guess? I don't know how that will go we will see.

If you are tempted to check it out, main branch should be stable, if you have any suggestions email me at calmtree.dev@gmail.com.
