# CalmTree

CalmTree is a Blender add-on for all the environment artist out there. This add-on enables the user to create complex trees quickly, whether it be for background or foreground. It is meant to give a basic or high quality tree mesh, depending on your needs. It can be used for quick drafting or almost complete asset creation.

This repo is for the general... free version of the addon, I plan on finishing this and moving onto a paid version.. I guess? I don't know how that will go we will see.

**This project is under active development. It might be unstable. I am making updates and fixing bugs right as you are reading this. A new version is just around the corner!**
